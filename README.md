Task Manager App

A simple task management application built with React, allowing users to create, update, delete, and reorder tasks. It includes features like task filtering, dark mode toggle, and undo/redo functionality for actions performed on tasks.

Features

Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Update Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed or update task details.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
Reorder Tasks: Tasks can be reordered through drag-and-drop.
Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed).
Undo/Redo Functionality: Undo and redo changes made to the tasks (e.g., adding, deleting, updating, and reordering tasks).
Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for the app.
Technologies Used

React: For building the user interface.
React DnD: For drag-and-drop task reordering.
useReducer: For state management, providing undo/redo functionality.
useMemo: For performance optimization when filtering tasks.
useCallback: For optimizing event handlers (such as task update and delete).
CSS: Custom styles for the app.
Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-app.git
cd task-manager-app
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

npm install
3. Start the development server
Run the following command to start the development server:

npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

Add Task: Enter a task description and click "Add Task" to create a new task.
Update Task: You can mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox next to it.
Delete Task: Remove a task by clicking the delete icon.
Reorder Tasks: Drag and drop tasks to change their order.
Filter Tasks: Use the filter buttons to view all tasks, only pending tasks, or only completed tasks.
Undo/Redo: Use the undo and redo buttons to revert or redo actions like adding, updating, deleting, or reordering tasks.
Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark mode using the "Dark Mode" button in the header.
Development Notes

The app uses useReducer for state management, allowing complex state updates with undo/redo functionality.
The state is stored in memory and also saved to localStorage to persist across page reloads.
Task reordering is done using react-dnd for drag-and-drop interactions.
Performance optimizations are achieved using useMemo for filtering tasks and useCallback for memoizing event handlers.

# Task Manager App

A **Task Manager** application built with **React**, providing the functionality to add, update, delete, reorder tasks, filter tasks by their status, and toggle between dark/light mode. The app also includes **undo/redo** functionality for managing task actions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to the list.
- **Update Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed or update the task details.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Reorder Tasks**: Rearrange tasks using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks by status — All, Pending, and Completed.
- **Undo/Redo**: Revert or redo any action taken on tasks (add, update, delete, reorder).
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized UI experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React DnD**: A drag-and-drop library used for task reordering.
- **useReducer**: Used for complex state management and undo/redo functionality.
- **useMemo**: Optimizes performance for filtering tasks.
- **useCallback**: Optimizes event handlers for task actions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the application.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-app.git
cd task-manager-app
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

npm install
3. Start the development server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

Add a Task:
Enter a task description in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
Update a Task:
Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
Edit task details if needed (this can be extended for more detailed edits).
Delete a Task:
Click on the delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
Reorder Tasks:
Drag and drop tasks to reorder them in your list.
Filter Tasks:
Use the "All", "Pending", or "Completed" filter buttons to view tasks by their status.
Undo/Redo Actions:
Use the undo button to revert the last action (add, update, delete, reorder).
Use the redo button to redo an undone action.
Dark Mode:
Toggle between dark and light mode using the "Dark Mode" button in the header.

Development Notes

State Management: The application uses useReducer for managing the tasks and implementing undo/redo functionality. This allows for more complex state transitions and better control of changes made to the tasks.
Persistence: The tasks are stored in localStorage so that they persist even when the page is refreshed. The app loads and saves the tasks from and to localStorage.
Drag-and-Drop: Task reordering is achieved using react-dnd (React Drag and Drop) to provide a smooth drag-and-drop interface.
Performance Optimization:
useMemo is used to optimize the performance of the task filtering to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
useCallback is used to memoize event handlers for task actions (add, delete, update) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
